# Distracted-Driving-Risk-Detection-Challenge
This work addresses a classification problem from a recent Kaggle competition. The challenge involves developing a model to classify driving risk levels using real-world time series data collected from urban driving sessions. The goal is to predict whether a given driving situation corresponds to a low, medium, high, or very high accident risk.
